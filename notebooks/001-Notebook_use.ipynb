This should already be installed for you if you are viewing this, but we will runs some tests below just to make sure.\n",

Some cells, such as the one this is written in, are 'text' cells, where we format the text in a language called [markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).\n",

In python, the `str` variable stores more than just the characters of the string!\n",
